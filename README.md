# Atmel-avr
This repository contains the different projects that has been shaped by me using Atmel-AVR.

You can find the custom libraries for controlling different buttons, LEDs, motor, PWM, timers, interrupts in 
the Libraries folder.

Different Projects can be found in the Project directory. These projects currently utilizes the Arduino Framework 
for 100% functionality. But a very little change in the include files and settings can make them work using AVR core
libraries directly.

Projects can be simulated on any 8-bit AVR-microcontrollers by making some little changes according to the hardware 
limitations of controller selected.
